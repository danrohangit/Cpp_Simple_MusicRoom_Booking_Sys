# Cpp_Simple_MusicRoom_Booking_Sys
- I sightread easy piano pieces on my free time, inspiring me to develop a simple music room booking app
- It is clearly made to be simple and in no way shape or form is my solution the most efficient.
- Databases is much better but i want to try purely with c++
- Also i am unsure if c++ can save booking details after inputs. I am not sure how to save the data.

## Music Room Booking App
- Owner owns two music rooms
- Owner needs to book for musicians
- Owner needs to check-in for musicians
- Owner needs to see details of booking with a given date
